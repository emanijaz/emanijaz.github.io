I'm currently working as a part-time Research Assistant under the supervision of [Dr. Naveed Arshad](https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/1352) at Energy Informatic Group [(EIG Lab)](https://web.lums.edu.pk/~eig/).

Project 1- Medium-Term Load Forecasting: The Research and Development project that involves the application of ML/Data Science and Data Analysis on the energy data of buildings. The goal is to accurately forecast the energy demand of buildings for a year span assuring no wastage of resources. This project is aimed as a thesis for my masters studies.


Project 2- Real-Time Spatio Temporal Emission Mapping: In this [Asia Connect Project](http://www.asiaconnectth.com/), we targeted at accurately predicting the AQI of all the regions of Lahore, Pakistan. I helped in the supervision of a team of 4 students for their research and development responsibilities in the project. Technologies used: Google Maps API, AWS EC2, MongoDB, React, Nodejs, and Heroku.
